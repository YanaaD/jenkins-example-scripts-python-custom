# Jenkins-example-scripts-python-custom.

This repo will be used to make a pipeline which runs a custom python script, which simply finds the mininimum sum of two lists.

## Important Note: This code is specifically tailored for Windows users!

## If you are using a Unix based system (MacOs or Linux) please note the differences:

**bat -> sh** 

**python -> python3/current python version**

You **must** make these changes in order for the **Jenkinsfile** to be useable for you
